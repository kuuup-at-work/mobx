# Writing asynchronous actions

The `action` wrapper / decorator only affects the currently running function, not functions that are scheduled (but not invoked) by the current function!
This means that if you have a `setTimeout`, promise`.then` or `async` construction, and in that callback some more state is changed, those callbacks should be wrapped in `action` as well! There are several ways to create asynchronous actions. No approach is strictly better then the other, but this section just list different approaches you can take to writing asynchronous code.
Let's start with a basic example:

### Promises

```javascript
mobx.useStrict(true) // don't allow state modifications outside actions

class Store {
	@observable githubProjects = []
	@observable state = "pending" // "pending" / "done" / "error"

	@action
	fetchProjects() {
		this.githubProjects = []
		this.state = "pending"
		fetchGithubProjectsSomehow().then(
			projects => {
				const filteredProjects = somePreprocessing(projects)
				this.githubProjects = filteredProjects
				this.state = "done"
			},
			error => {
				this.state = "error"
			}
		)
	}
}
```

The above example would throw exceptions, as the callbacks passed to the `fethGithubProjectsSomehow` promise are not part of the `fetchProjects` action, as actions only apply to the current stack.

A first simple fix is to extract the callbacks to actions. (Note that binding is important here to get a correct `this`!):

```javascript
class Store {
	@observable githubProjects = []
	@observable state = "pending" // "pending" / "done" / "error"

	@action
	fetchProjects() {
		this.githubProjects = []
		this.state = "pending"
		fetchGithubProjectsSomehow().then(this.fetchProjectsSuccess, this.fetchProjectsError)
	}

	@action.bound // callback action
	fetchProjectsSuccess(projects) {
		const filteredProjects = somePreprocessing(projects)
		this.githubProjects = filteredProjects
		this.state = "done"
	}

	@action.bound // callback action
	fetchProjectsError(error) {
		this.state = "error"
	}
}
```

Although this is clean and explicit, it might get a bit verbose with complex async flows. Alternative, you can wrap the promise callbacks with the `action` keyword. It is recommended, but not mandatory, to give them a name as well:

```javascript
mobx.useStrict(true) // don't allow state modifications outside actions

class Store {
	@observable githubProjects = []
	@observable state = "pending" // "pending" / "done" / "error"

	@action
	fetchProjects() {
		this.githubProjects = []
		this.state = "pending"
		fetchGithubProjectsSomehow().then(
			// inline created action
			action("fetchSuccess", projects => {
				const filteredProjects = somePreprocessing(projects)
				this.githubProjects = filteredProjects
				this.state = "done"
			}),
			// inline created action
			action("fetchError", error => {
				this.state = "error"
			})
		)
	}
}
```

### The `runInAction` utility

A downside of inline actions is that TypeScript does not apply type inference on them, so you would have type all your callbacks.
Instead of creating an action for the entire callback, you can also run only the state modifying part of the callback in an action.
The advantage of this pattern is that it encourages you to not litter the place with `action`, but rather put all the state modifications as much as possible at the end of the whole process:

```javascript
mobx.useStrict(true) // don't allow state modifications outside actions

class Store {
	@observable githubProjects = []
	@observable state = "pending" // "pending" / "done" / "error"

	@action
	fetchProjects() {
		this.githubProjects = []
		this.state = "pending"
		fetchGithubProjectsSomehow().then(
			projects => {
				const filteredProjects = somePreprocessing(projects)
				// put the 'final' modification in an anonymous action
				runInAction(() => {
					this.githubProjects = filteredProjects
					this.state = "done"
				})
			},
			error => {
				// the alternative ending of this process:...
				runInAction(() => {
					this.state = "error"
				})
			}
		)
	}
}
```

Note that `runInAction`'s can also be given a name as first argument. `runInAction(f)` is in fact just sugar for `action(f)()`

### async / await

Async / await based functions can initially seem confusing when starting with actions.
Because lexically they appear to synchronous functions, it gives the impression that `@action` applies to the entire function.
Which is of course not the case, as async / await is just syntactic sugar around a promise based process.
As a result, `@action` only applies to the code block until the first `await`.
And after each `await` a new asynchronous function is started, so after each `await`, state modifying code should be wrapped as action.
This is where `runInAction` comes in handy again:

```javascript
mobx.useStrict(true) // don't allow state modifications outside actions

class Store {
	@observable githubProjects = []
	@observable state = "pending" // "pending" / "done" / "error"

	@action
	async fetchProjects() {
		this.githubProjects = []
		this.state = "pending"
		try {
			const projects = await fetchGithubProjectsSomehow()
			const filteredProjects = somePreprocessing(projects)
			// after await, modifying state again, needs an actions:
			runInAction(() => {
				this.state = "done"
				this.githubProjects = filteredProjects
			})
		} catch (error) {
			runInAction(() => {
				this.state = "error"
			})
		}
	}
}
```

### babel-plugin-mobx-deep-action

If you use babel, there is a plugin that scans for `@action` methods and automatically wraps all callbacks and await statements properly in actions during transpilation: [mobx-deep-action](https://github.com/mobxjs/babel-plugin-mobx-deep-action).

### Generators & asyncAction

Finally there is the `asyncAction` utility in the [`mobx-utils` package](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils) that uses generators behind the scenes to automatically wrap yielded promises in actions. The advantage of this is that it is syntactically very close to async / await (with different keywords), and no manually action wrapping is needed for async parts, resulting in very clean code.
Just make sure every `yield` returns a promise.

`asyncAction` can be used as decorator and as function (just like `@action`).
`asyncAction` integrates neatly with MobX development tools, so that it is easy to trace the process of the async function.
For more details see the docs of [asyncAction](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils#asyncaction).

```javascript
import {asyncAction} from "mobx-utils"

mobx.useStrict(true) // don't allow state modifications outside actions

class Store {
	@observable githubProjects = []
	@observable state = "pending" // "pending" / "done" / "error"

	@asyncAction
	*fetchProjects() { // <- note the star, this a generator function!
		this.githubProjects = []
		this.state = "pending"
		try {
			const projects = yield fetchGithubProjectsSomehow() // yield instead of await
			const filteredProjects = somePreprocessing(projects)
			// the asynchronous blocks will automatically be wrapped actions
			this.state = "done"
			this.githubProjects = filteredProjects
		} catch (error) {
			this.state = "error"
		}
	}
}
```
